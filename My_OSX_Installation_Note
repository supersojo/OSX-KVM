The software
- manjaro
- qemu
- virt-manager

According HighSierra note in OSX-KVM, we can install HighSierra very easyly.
But when passthrough gtx650, some work to be done.
- Install multibeast to change system defination to IMac14,2
  Or Install clover configurator to change system defination
- Install hackintools to install Lilu and Whatevergreen kexts to /L/E (maybe not needed i will check later)
