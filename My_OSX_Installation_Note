The hardware
- i5 6500 (skylake 1151)
- giga b150m-d3h
- gtx650
  - because the origion vbios doesnt support uefi so use below method to enable uefi support vbios

The software
- manjaro
- qemu
- virt-manager

According HighSierra note in OSX-KVM, we can install HighSierra very easyly.
But when passthrough gtx650, some work to be done.
- Install multibeast to change system defination to IMac14,2
  Or Install clover configurator to change system defination
- Install hackintools to install Lilu and Whatevergreen kexts to /L/E (maybe not needed i will check later)

No DVI or hdmi cable at hand so i use vga right now. Maybe it's the cause for me to change system defination to IMac14,2.
I buy DVI cable recently so i will check later.

The sleep function doesnt work, just disable sleep in osx.

My usb mouse cant passthrough so i select another one then it works well.I dont know why.
